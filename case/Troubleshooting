The first submission gives the error on: 
the second case was created to check if one line to be deleted and see if it works. 
## There are some solutions which might help to solve the issue:
1. Delete '' and see if the case could be built up successfully.
Result: After deleting the line, the case couldn't be set up. (RUN ./case.setup failed)
2. Try manually load all required modules after uninstalling all modules. 
Process: RUN module purge to uninstall 
and RUN: 
module load NiaEnv/2018a
module load perl/5.20.3
module load cmake/3.10.3
module load git/2.39.1
module load subversion/1.9.7
module load intel/2018.3
module load openmpi/3.1.1
module load hdf5-mpi/1.10.2
module load netcdf-mpi/4.6.1
module load pnetcdf/1.9.0; 
to verify, run: 
module list;
Submit the job
Result: Not avaiable yet.
3.The other possibility might due to module environment NiaEnv/2018a is not set up by default(according to Niagara CESM github, it might be neccessary to set NiaEnv/2018a instead of NiaEnv/2019b.)
Prcoess:RUN nano ~/.bashrc and add 'module load NiaEnv/2018a' to the file, apply the change by sourcing the file: source ~/.bashrc.
To verify, close the tab and restart the window to see what is the default version right now: RUN 'module --default avail'
Then submit the job.
Result: Not avaiable yet.
