# Paleoclimate simulation using Community Earth System Model(CESM)
The `Visualization` folder contains code for plot visualization using Python with model output in netCDF files. For more detailed information on how to convert NCL files to Python scripts for model visualization, see (https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_1377048729833291776).
## Installing, building and running CESM

## CESM tutorial:practical and lectures
"NCAR provides an annual CESM tutorial that covers both the conceptual framework of CESM and its practical applications. Tutorials for each year can be found [here](https://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/events/tutorials/). I personally watched the 2020 tutorial, available [here](https://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/events/tutorials/2020/coursework.html); both slides and recordings can be found at the link.
